# Using Custom Components in Constellation

## Overview

This project provides you with an environment to extend Constellation by giving you tools to create and publish custom components that are not available from the Constellation installation.

## Before you begin

Review the following checklist before you create a Constellation DX component:

## Design considerations

Involve an Experience Designer in your process. This will help you determine the exact issue to be resolved. For more information on the role of an Experience Designer, see **Experience Designer** [here](https://community.pega.com/roles/experience-designer).

## The Experience Designer must meet the following requirements:

Must have a background in UI and UX design.
Must understand Pega's best practices for design. For more information, see **Best practices for designing with the Constellation design system** [here](https://design.pega.com/design/getting-started/).

## Functionality considerations

Check if an existing component in App Studio contains the features you need. If not, check for existing components that contain similar features.
Connect with Pega Support to find out if a component containing a similar feature will be included in the next release. If yes, assess if you can wait for the next release.

## Maintenance considerations

Ensure you have the bandwidth to maintain the Constellation DX component and keep it up-to-date with every release of Pega Infinity. Evaluate if doing this might prevent you from upgrading to future releases of Pega Infinity.
Evaluate if you are able to meet the compliance standards for data privacy and accessibility for Constellation DX components. Note that not meeting these standards might lead to legal compliance issues.
